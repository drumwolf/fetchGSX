# parse-gsx
This project consists of a pair of JavaScript modules which will parse a Google spreadsheet document and render clean, readable JSON data for you to process as you wish.

- `parse-gsx-ajax.js` (for web)
- `parse-gsx-node.js` (for Node.js)

## Setup

We will assume that you already have the following:  
- a Google Docs account
- Node.js installed on your computer (if you are using `parse-gsx-node.js`)
- JQuery available for use (if you are using `parse-gsx-ajax.js`)

### Google Spreadsheet

If you have a Gmail address or a YouTube account, you should also have access to Google Docs.  All of them are under the same Google account.

If you're logged into your Google account, go here:  https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive

When you click "NEW", select "Google Sheets" to create a new Google spreadsheet document.
