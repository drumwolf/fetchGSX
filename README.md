# parse-gsx
This project consists of a pair of JavaScript modules which will parse a Google spreadsheet document and render clean, readable JSON data for you to process as you wish.

- `parse-gsx-ajax.js` (for web)
- `parse-gsx-node.js` (for Node.js)

## Setup

We will assume that you already have both of the following:  a Google Drive account, and Node.js installed on your computer.
